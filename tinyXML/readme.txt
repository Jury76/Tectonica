<h1> TinyXML </h1>

TinyXML is a simple, small, C++ XML parser that can be easily 
integrated into other programs.  This is a modified version of that.

<h2> IMPORTANT WARNING: </h2>

This is a heavily cut-down version of tinyXML - made to be easier
to build and to be used within 'wasm' - the Web Assembly language.

If you intend to use tinyXML for ANY project other than this one,
I STRONGLY recommend that you go to the original source and download
from there:

    https://sourceforge.net/projects/tinyxml/

The standard TinyXML licensing terms apply to this hacked version:
